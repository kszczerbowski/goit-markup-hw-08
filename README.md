This is a homework project done during my IT Full Stack Developer course made in GoIT school in the end of HTML & CSS module.

This website is an example of a landing page
This website enables you to look for images available on Pixabay. The design is responsive and the images' grid changes depending on your screen's width. You can choose whether you'd like to load more pictures with a button or just via infinite scroll. There is also a button which lets you go back quickly to the very top of the website in order to save you the trouble with long scrolling.

Tech stack: HTML, CSS, SCSS, a bit of JavaScript.
