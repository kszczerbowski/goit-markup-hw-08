This is a homework project done during my IT Full Stack Developer course made in GoIT school in the end of HTML & CSS module.

This website is an example of a landing page. Main site shows the team, the company's business and several clients whereas the Portfolio page shows some examples of the company's products.

Tech stack: HTML, CSS, SCSS, a bit of JavaScript.
